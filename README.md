# Recipez

Food recipes app created with Vite and React, using the EDAMAM API. For demo purposes only, as part of a portfolio.

If you wish to use it, just download the repo, unzip and open the project in your code editor, run "npx vite" to preview the site in development mode. You will need to create an account with EDAMAM and create an .env file in the project in order for it to work
